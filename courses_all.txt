~~~~~CS 410 Text Information Systems~~~~~
The growth of “big data” created unprecedented opportunities to leverage computational and statistical approaches, which turn raw data into actionable knowledge that can support various application tasks. This is especially true for the optimization of decision making in virtually all application domains, such as health and medicine, security and safety, learning and education, scientific discovery, and business intelligence. This course covers general computational techniques for building intelligent text information systems to help users manage and make use of large amounts of text data in all kinds of applications. Text data include all data in the form of natural language text (e.g., English text or Chinese text), including all web pages, social media data such as tweets, news, scientific literature, emails, government documents, and many other kinds of enterprise data. Text data play an essential role in our lives. Since we communicate using natural languages, we produce and consume a large amount of text data every day covering all kinds of topics. The explosive growth of text data makes it impossible for people to consume all the relevant text data in a timely manner. The two main techniques to assist people in consuming, digesting, and making use of the text data are: 1.Text retrieval, which helps identify the most relevant text data to a particular problem from a large collection of text documents, thus avoiding processing a large number of non -relevant documents 2.Text mining, which helps users further analyze and digest the found relevant text data and extract actionable knowledge for finishing a task This course covers both text retrieval and text mining, so as to provide you with the opportunity to see the complete spectrum of techniques used in building an intelligent text information system. Building on two MOOCs covering the same topic and including a course project, this course enables you to learn the basic concepts, principles, and general techniques in text retrieval and mining, as well as gain hands -on experience with using software tools to develop interesting text data applications.  Theory, design, and implementation of text-based information systems. Text analysis, retrieval models (e.g., Boolean, vector space, probabilistic), text categorization, text filtering, clustering, retrieval system design and implementation, and applications to web information management.

~~~~~CS 498 Cloud Computing Applications~~~~~
Welcome to CS498: Cloud Computing Applications! This 17-week course is designed to give you a comprehensive view of the world of cloud computing and Big Data. Each week has between 3to 5hours of learning material (video lectures+ readings), a quiz (usually1 hour), and for most weeks a programming assignment. You should expect to spend10 -12hours per week on this course in average. Please note that the times specified for the programming assignments are averages. This means that some students may finish the assignment in2 hours, and a few others may need to spend20 hours or more on an MP. Likewise, some weeks have more training material than others. Since all course material is available from day1, we expect you to proactively plan your schedule in advance. The programming assignments are a major component of the learning process of this course, and to some extent they are designed as self -learning and exploration opportunities. They are all auto- graded, and you have unlimited number of tries before each assignment’s deadline. In this course we cover a multitude of technologies that comprise the modern stack of cloud computing. Cloud computing is an information technology revolution that has impact ed many enterprise computing systems in major ways, and it will change the face of computing in the years to come. We start by introducing some major concepts in cloud computing, the economical foundations of cloud computing, and the concept of Big Data. We also cover the concept of software defined architectures, and how cloud service providers organize their offerings. We also will compare Infrastructure as a Service offered by the big three: Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, including Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a Service along a few others.   Serverless computing has gained massive popularity in recent years, as it is both economical and easy to use and deploy. We cover serverless computing, serverless storage, and middleware required to weave on -site or end -user applications to serverless resources. We then shift our focus slightly to the topic of big data programming, and how Big Data systems are now mainly deployed in cloud environments. We cover MapReduce programming in both Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. The next three weeks focus on cloud storage services. We introduce cloud object storage systems, virtual hard drives (block storage), and virtual archival storage options, including a discussion of Dropbox. This course also introduces large -scale data storage, along with the difficulties and problems of consensus in enormous stores that use large quantities of processors, memories, and disks. We also present distributed key-value stores and in-memory databases used for caching layers (e.g.  Memcached and Redis) used in data centers for performance. Next we present NewSQL and No SQL Databases in the cloud. We visit HBase, the scalable, low latency database that supports database operations in applications that use Hadoop. Then, we will show how Spark SQL can program SQL queries on huge data and present Distributed Publish/Subscribe systems using Kafka, a distributed log messaging system that is finding wide use in connecting Big Data and streaming applications together to form complex systems. Right after the midterm exam (which is proctored by the ProctorU service), we switch to higher end applications in the cloud. We start by exploring how the Cloud opens up data analytics to huge volumes of data that are static or streamed at high velocity and represent an enormous variety of information. Cloud applications and data analytics represent a disruptive change in the ways that society is informed by, and uses information. We also introduce some common enterprise-level analytics applications that are offered by major cloud providers. We then look at graph processing, graph databases and machine learning in the cloud. We introduce the ideas of graph processing and present Pregel, Giraph, and Spark GraphX, as well as machine learning. Spark ML and Mllib continue the theme of programmability and application construction. We also cover the Machine Learning lifecycle, and how different cloud services contribute to it. We then turn our attention to Fast Data systems, such as Apache Storm and Flux. We disc uss real -time data streaming and introduce Storm technology that is used widely in the industry. We continue with Spark Streaming, Lambda and Kappa architectures, and a lesson on a complete streaming ecosystem. After that, we move on to the topics of virtualization and containers, which is a fundamental technology behind many cloud- based services. We cover virtualization and containers with a deeper focus, including lectures on Docker, Docker Compose, ECS, Kubernates and Infrastructure as Code. Finally, we wrap up the course by talking about the future trends, and wraps up with an interview with an industry -expert cloud architect.
